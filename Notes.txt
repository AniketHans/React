Framework v/s Library
1. Framework has very strict rules about variable naming conventions, folder structure etc
2. Library does not have any such rules to be used.
3. React is a library

React
1. React makes SPA (Single Page Applications). It means the page does not get reloaded.
2. New documentation of react is at react.dev
3. We have react as the library and we have react-dom and react-native as attachments
4. React dom is used when we work on websites. It is basically the react library implementation on web. 
5. React native is used when we work on mobile apps.

npm vs npx
1. `npm` stands for Node Package Manager. `npm` allows users to install node packages into the system.
2. `npx` stands for Node Package Executer. `npx` allows users to execute the packages directly without need of installing them first.

Creating React app
1. `npx creat-react-app <app-name>`. create-react-app is a very bulky utility. It installs a lot of things that we might or might not use in our projects.
2. `npm create vite@latest` is used to create react app using vite bundler. 

How react renders html when run
1. create-react-app
    1.1. React app created using create-react-app has index.html file in public folder. This index.html file is loaded when the react app is run.
    1.2. React under the hood uses JS and you need to inject JS to the html file for its working using <script> tag.
    1.3. The script is not injected directly here but react-script dependency (found in package.json) goes to the index file and then injects the JS file (say index.js) into it behind the scene.
2. vite
    2.1. The react app created using vite has index.html file present in the root of the project.
    2.2. It directly injects the JS (say main.js) file to the index.html using <script> tag.
3. In both the cases, in the injected files (index.js or main.js), we have code like:-
    `ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render( <App /> );`
    here, React creates it own DOM (called Virtual DOM) and compared it with actual DOM to know which DOM elements need changes.
4. Each index.html file has a `<div id='root'>`.
5. Thus, react injects/renders the <App/> component into the div with id=root on the index.html page.
6. Since, there is only one index.html file in the whole react app, thats why react makes a SPA (Single Page Application)


<> </>
1. Empty div or `<> </>` are known as fragments in react.

React elements
1. React tries to form a tree from the html that we return in a function. It means all the components are converted to a tree by bundlers like babel, vite etc in React.
2. For eg. we returned `<a href="www.google.com">Google Link</a>` in a component (or function).
3. React will try to create a tree out of it,
    {
        type:'a',
        props:{
            href: 'www.google.com',
            target: '_blank
        },
        children: 'Google Link'
    }
4. The above tree needs a custom renderer to understand it and convert the HTML written in it to such a form understandable by the browser.



Adding variables in JSX
1. If you want to add a variable in returned JSX, you need to enclose it in `{<variable-name>}`.
2. E.g, `const name ="AH"; return (<h1> Hi! {name}</h1>)`
3. Note, you enclose evaluated expression in `{}`. It means you can't write JS code (say if else etc) in it but the evaluated value of the expression.
4. In React.createElement(type,props,children,...variables), the last parameter is varibles. All the injected variables are passed to this createElement function
